# Designing a music-streaming webapp

## Goal here was to deepen my knowledge in html & css as well as persona oriented programming by designing a multipage webapp

I did an analysis of existing streaming services (weaknesses and strengths) and defined my target group with the help of personas.
To continue I created a sketch of the webapp followed by a mockup.

I layed special interest in horizontal sliders as well as sticked and functional headers and footers.

**Technology:** HTML & CSS(Tailwindcss)
